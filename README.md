# ProgrammingProject1_SMP
Goal: To write program that integrates different programming concepts, structures and packages from Python, integrate Markdown.
Write a program that projects population growth for a certain time period. Your inputs should include the initial population, the growth rate (e.g. .12%), and the number of years to project. Use the following formula to calculate your population growth: Pt = P0 × e^(rt)
where e is Euler’s number, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the number of years to project.
